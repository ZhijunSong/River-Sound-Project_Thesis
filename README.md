# River-Sound-Project_Thesis
Maxmsp,webcam,sound installation
This is my thesis project working on maxmsp and webcamera visions. 
It should also include plugins like cv.jit, CNMAT,and Ambisonic to build this project.

The Project is working on convert a space into a underwater experience. Webcamera will detect the position of those people,
and response back to the sound loop by shifting the sound media with the location.
